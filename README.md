A Blog using Django-Capstone Project CS50: Web Programming with Python and Django
Description
I've designed and developed a file management web application that will allow users to add, update, and delete files using Django. The web application supports pdf, image, document, audio, and video files. The User Registration allows the user to register themselves to upload the files, files that are already uploaded can be downloaded without login. The Add File allows the user to add title, description, and upload the file in any of the supported formats. The Edit File allows the uploaded file to be changes. The Delete File allows the user to delete files that they have uploaded. User can edit the description and details of their profile. The Django Admin Interface allows the site administrator to view, add, edit, and delete any file and user on the application. I believe this project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements mentioned for the capstone project.
